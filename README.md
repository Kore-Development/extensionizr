Demo (unofficial, last updated 5/18/2021): [extensionizr.pqtato.pw](https://extensionizr.pqtato.pw)

This is simply a fork I created for the purpose of making minor tweaks to the code (mainly appearance stuff). 

I was originally going to create my own extension template generator, but figured someone else would have already done it, and done it better than I probably could have! 

It's not the most complex thing I've worked with lately (I'm grateful that it's just client-side for a change...), but [altryne/Alex Wolkov](https://github.com/altryne) has my thanks for not only having a live instance of the generator, but also for making the code available. Support/use his version! :)

Please see the original README below for details on the original project, and support that version :)

Another *izr? When will this stop
---------------------------------
Extensionizr is a simple way to jump start your chrome extension development. Just select the type of extension you want, choose permissions and you're off.

Why does this exist?
--------------------
Because I got super tired creating the file structure for a new extension over and over again. 
Extensionizr will be always updated with the latest chrome manifest changes. 
In addition, I wanted to create a client-side only tool. Extensionizr doesn't use server side code! Don't believe me? Checkout the github repo.

Based on open source
--------------------
Extensionizr is 90% based on open source pieces I put together. 
It's heavily inspired by Initializr by Jonathan Verrecchia.
