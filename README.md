<h3>Why does this exist?</h3><br>
Firstly, this is just my fork of the <a href="https://github.com/altryne/extensionizr">original code</a>, made so that I can tweak minor things (mainly appearance-wise).
This isn't some huge upgrade to the original utility or anything like that. <br>
The original author stated:<br>
> Because I got super tired creating the file structure for a new extension over and over again. 
> Extensionizr will be always updated with the latest chrome manifest changes.
> In addition, I wanted to create a client-side only tool. Extensionizr doesn't use server side code! Don't believe me? Checkout the github repo.

As for this fork of the code, I was going to write my own extension template generator, but figured someone would have already done it, and had likely done a better job than I could have. Fortunately, I was right! 

Based on open source
--------------------
Extensionizr is 90% based on open source pieces I put together. 
It's heavily inspired by Initializr by Jonathan Verrecchia.
